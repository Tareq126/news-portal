    <h3 class="mt-5 mb-2">Why should we use template strings?</h3>
    <p>
        Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate
        variables and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It
        allows us to create strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements. Another great thing that comes with
        template strings are tags. Tags are functions that take a string and the decomposed parts of the string as
        parameters and are great for converting strings to different entities.

    <h6>
        Some key features of template strings are given bellow: <br>
    </h6>
    1. Writing Multi-line Strings Directly
    The simplest usage of the template literal is to write a multi-line string directly: <br>

    2. String Interpolation with Expressions
    Writing multi-line strings is just the tip of the iceberg. The power of the template string literal is shown by its
    string interpolation ability. <br>

    3. Using Tagged Templates for Complex Scenarios
    The tagged template is a more advanced usage of the template strings.
